Welcome to ffxiv-combat-simulator's documentation!
==================================================

**FFXIV-combat-simulator** or **ffxivcalc** for short, is a library/API that lets anyone simulate combat from the game 
*Final Fantasy XIV Online*. It can be used to simulate any sort of rotation with any sort of team composition. It even allows
for completely customized actions to be performed by a player. This tool will let people (and you) experiment and optimize rotations and even entire raids in
order to get lower kill times and higher DPS. This tool can do much more, and you can find all about it here. 

If you are not very familiar with code but still want to simulate simply read the *User interface* part.
