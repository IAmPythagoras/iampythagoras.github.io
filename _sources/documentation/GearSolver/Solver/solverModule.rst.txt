Solver 
======

This module contains the code for the Rotation BiS solver and other functions.

**Import**

.. code-block:: python

    from ffxivcalc.GearSolver.Solver import getBaseStat, getGearDPSValue, computeDamageValue, computeGCDTimer, findGCDTimerRange, BiSSolver, materiaBiSSolverV3, materiaDHAndDetSolver, pietySolver


.. note::

    Only the implementation is discussed here. If you wish to know more about the algorithm of the solver and its results please go on the official github and you can find the 
    links to those pages in the readme.
