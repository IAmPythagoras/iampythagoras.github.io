API documentation
=================

In order to make it easier for certain people to use the **ffxiv-combat-simulator**, it can be used as an API that will process requests to simulate fights
and return values corresponding to the result of the simulation.

As of now, there is no public server on which the API is running, meaning that you will have to run it locally. The documentation will be updated as soon as such a public API
is available. For now, we will shown how to host the API locally so you can use it anyway.

Locally host the API
--------------------

The first thing you will need to install is *uvicorn*.

.. code-block:: text

    pip install uvicorn

Now simply run this command:

.. code-block:: text

    python -m uvicorn ffxivcalc.API.API:app 

This will launch the API on your local machine. There is documentation generated at *HOSTING_ADDRESS/docs*, but the big lines will be explained here.

.. note::

    The generated documentation is more useful than what will be explained here since it will let you try some requests to the API.
    Hence I recommend to simply host the API locally and go read the generated documentation.

Simulate a fight using the API
------------------------------

The API's most useful function is to let anyone request the simulation of a fight. In order to do so, we have designed a JSON file format which the API can read and translate into
a *Fight* object that can then be ran by the simulator. Afterward, the API will translate the *Fight* object's result into a JSON file that will then be returned by the API. 

Here is an example of a JSON file the API is expecting as input: 

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "data": {
            "fightInfo": {
                "fightDuration": 500,

.. note::

    The *GraphInfoDPS* and *GraphInfoPPS* generally have informations needed to genereted a *DPS Vs. Time* or *PPS Vs. Time* graph, but were not included
    in the above example in order to shorten it.


failedRequirementEventList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This contains a list of all times when a player ran into a possible problem when casting an action. The event contains informations like that requirement was failed, at what time, what player, 
maybe some additonal informations and if the requirement was fatal (if it was fatal then it made the simulation stop).

ProcsInfo
^^^^^^^^^

This contains information regarding the number of used proc by a player as well as the number of expected proc. This lets someone see how realistic the rotation they are doing in the simulation
is.



.. I kind of agree with the main page, leylines relative.
